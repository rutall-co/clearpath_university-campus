# Adding Custom Models to Gazebo
Integrate custom models into your Gazebo simulations by following these steps:
1. **Model Transfer**:
Copy this folder `unicampus1` to your Gazebo model directory:
```bash
cp -r models/unicampus1 ~/.gazebo/models/
```
2. **Verification**:
Ensure the models are correctly copied by checking the Gazebo model directory:
```bash
ls ~/.gazebo/models/
```
The output should list the custom model names.
